# Motion to Slack Integration

A simple integration that monitors your [Motion](https://usemotion.com) tasks and automatically posts to Slack when you complete them. Perfect for keeping your team updated on your progress without manual updates.

## What is Motion?

[Motion](https://usemotion.com) is an AI-powered productivity platform that combines your calendar, tasks, projects, and meeting assistant into one intelligent app. It uses AI to:

- **Automatically prioritize and schedule your tasks** based on deadlines, dependencies, and your availability
- **Manage projects with AI** that creates tasks, assigns work, and tracks progress automatically
- **Take meeting notes** and generate action items without you lifting a finger
- **Optimize your schedule** hundreds of times per day to ensure you never miss a deadline

Motion helps individuals and teams get work done 2x faster with 90% fewer check-ins, emails, and status update meetings.

## About This Integration

This is a **one-way integration** that:
- üîç Polls Motion every minute for newly completed tasks
- üì¢ Posts formatted notifications to your chosen Slack channel
- üö´ Prevents duplicate notifications with state tracking
- üîÑ Automatically retries on failures
- üöÄ Deploys easily to Railway (or any Python host)
- üõ°Ô∏è Includes robust error handling and environment validation

## ‚ö° Incredibly Efficient & Cost-Effective

This integration is designed to be **extremely lightweight** and cost-effective:

### üìä **Actual Production Costs**
- **Monthly cost on Railway**: **~$0.20** ü§Ø
- **Memory usage**: ~760 MB (minimal footprint)
- **CPU usage**: Nearly zero (spends 99%+ time sleeping)
- **Network traffic**: Minimal API calls only

### üöÄ **Why So Efficient?**
- **Smart polling**: Only checks Motion API once per minute
- **Efficient sleep cycles**: Python's `time.sleep()` consumes no CPU while waiting
- **Minimal dependencies**: Lightweight libraries (requests, python-dotenv)
- **State tracking**: Prevents unnecessary duplicate processing
- **Optimized API calls**: Only fetches completed tasks, not all tasks

### üí° **Cost Comparison**
- **$0.20/month** = Less than 
- **50x cheaper** than typical serverless solutions
- **Way cheaper** than webhooks or real-time solutions
- **No complex infrastructure** needed

At 20 cents per month, you get real-time task notifications without breaking the bank. This proves that simple polling solutions can be incredibly effective for low-frequency events like task completions!

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PSkinnerTech/motion-slack-integration.git
   cd motion-slack-integration
   ```

#### API Key
1. Log into [Motion](https://usemotion.com)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API & Integrations**
3. Click **"Create New API Key"**
4. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)
5. Save it as `MOTION_API_KEY` in your .env file

#### Workspace ID

#### Workspace ID

**Option 1: Use the helper script** (Recommended)
```bash
# After setting up your .env with MOTION_API_KEY
python find_workspace_id.py
```

**Option 2: Manual method**
1. Go to Motion and open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Navigate to the Network tab
3. Refresh the page or click around in Motion
4. Look for API calls to `api.usemotion.com`
5. Find a request that includes `workspaceId` in the URL or response
6. Copy that workspace ID (it should be a UUID like `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`)
7. Save it as `MOTION_WORKSPACE_ID` in your .env file

### 3. Setting Up Slack Bot

This integration only needs a simple Slack bot that can post messages. Here's exactly what to do:

#### Create the Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **"Create New App"**
3. Choose **"From scratch"** (not from manifest)
4. Enter:
   - **App Name**: `Motion Task Notifier` (or your preferred name)
   - **Workspace**: Select your workspace
5. Click **"Create App"**

#### Configure Bot Permissions

1. In the left sidebar, click **"OAuth & Permissions"**
2. Scroll down to **"Scopes"** section
3. Under **"Bot Token Scopes"**, click **"Add an OAuth Scope"**
4. Add these permissions:
   - `chat:write` - Allows the bot to send messages
   - `chat:write.public` - Allows posting to public channels without joining them

#### Install the App to Your Workspace

1. Scroll back to the top of the **"OAuth & Permissions"** page
2. Click **"Install to Workspace"**
3. Review the permissions and click **"Allow"**
4. You'll now see a **"Bot User OAuth Token"** that starts with `xoxb-`
5. **Copy this token** - this is your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` for the .env file

#### Add the Bot to Your Channel

In Slack, go to your target channel (e.g., #dev-rel) and type:
```
/invite @Motion Task Notifier
```
(Use whatever name you gave your app)

#### What You DON'T Need

This is a simple posting bot, so you can ignore these Slack app features:
- ‚ùå Event Subscriptions
- ‚ùå Interactivity & Shortcuts
- ‚ùå Slash Commands
- ‚ùå Incoming Webhooks
- ‚ùå Socket Mode
- ‚ùå Verification Token
- ‚ùå Client ID/Secret
- ‚ùå Signing Secret

These features are for receiving data FROM Slack or building interactive apps. We only need to POST to Slack.

#### Test Your Bot Token

To verify your setup works, you can run this quick test:
```python
import requests

token = "xoxb-YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE"
response = requests.post(
    "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
    json={"channel": "#your-channel", "text": "Test message from Motion integration! üöÄ"}
)
print(response.json())  # Should show "ok": true
```

### 4. Deploy to Railway

## Testing Your Setup

Before deploying to Railway, it's recommended to test your Motion API connection locally to ensure everything is configured correctly.

### **Test Motion API Connection**

The project includes a comprehensive test script to validate your Motion API setup:

```bash
python test_motion_api.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ **API Key validation** - Confirms your Motion API key is working
- ‚úÖ **User authentication** - Verifies you can access your Motion account
- ‚úÖ **Workspace access** - Lists all your workspaces and confirms the target workspace ID
- ‚úÖ **Task retrieval** - Tests fetching tasks from your workspace
- ‚úÖ **Completed tasks** - Shows recent completed tasks to verify the integration will work

**Example output:**
```
üß™ Testing Motion API Connection...

‚úÖ API Key found: dI/Bnrgo/qjVSyn3H5Cr...
‚úÖ Workspace ID: L8YNMqtk32fD7WkMl8Nym

üîç Test 1: Getting user info...
‚úÖ User: Patrick Skinner (patrick@clgcorporation.com)

üîç Test 2: Listing workspaces...
‚úÖ Found 6 workspace(s):
  ‚úÖ NVM (L8YNMqtk32fD7WkMl8Nym)
  ‚ö™ My Tasks (Private) (K4lCA17lbuLxwD5aVaiGG)
  ...

üîç Test 3: Checking workspace L8YNMqtk32fD7WkMl8Nym...
‚úÖ Workspace ID is valid and accessible

üîç Test 4: Getting tasks from workspace...
‚úÖ Found 204 tasks in workspace
‚úÖ Found 87 completed tasks

üéâ All Motion API tests passed! The API is working correctly.
```

**If the test fails**, it will show you exactly what's wrong and suggest fixes:
- Invalid API key ‚Üí Regenerate your Motion API key
- 401 Unauthorized ‚Üí Check if you have Team/Enterprise plan (Individual plans don't have API access)
- Workspace not found ‚Üí Verify your workspace ID is correct

**Run this test whenever:**
- Setting up the integration for the first time
- Getting deployment errors
- Suspecting Motion API issues
- After changing API keys or workspace IDs

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables. Create a `.env` file with:

```bash
# Required
MOTION_API_KEY=your_motion_api_key_here
MOTION_WORKSPACE_ID=12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here

# Optional
SLACK_CHANNEL=#dev-rel  # Default: #dev-rel
POLL_INTERVAL=60        # Default: 60 seconds
```

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MOTION_API_KEY` | Your Motion API key | Required |
| `MOTION_WORKSPACE_ID` | Your Motion workspace ID (UUID format) | Required |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Slack bot OAuth token (starts with xoxb-) | Required |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL` | Slack channel to post to | #dev-rel |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | Seconds between checks | 60 |

## Message Format

When a task is completed, the bot posts:

```
‚úÖ Task Completed: Design new landing page
üìù Description: Create mockups for the new product landing page
üìÅ Project: Website Redesign
‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 2h 30m
üìä Status: Done
‚úì Completed at: 3:45 PM
```

## Example Use Cases

- **Team Visibility**: Keep your team updated on what you're completing without manual status updates
- **Daily Standups**: Review yesterday's completions easily in Slack
- **Time Tracking**: See how long tasks actually took vs estimates
- **Project Progress**: Track completion velocity for specific projects
- **Accountability**: Create a record of completed work

## Troubleshooting

### Motion API Issues

**First, run the test script to diagnose the problem:**
```bash
python test_motion_api.py
```

This will help identify if the issue is with your API key, workspace access, or Motion plan.

### Motion API Access
- **"Unauthorized" errors?** Make sure you have a Team or Enterprise Motion plan - Individual plans don't include API access
- **Can't find API settings?** Look under Settings ‚Üí API & Integrations (only visible on Team/Enterprise plans)

### Environment Variables Not Loading in Railway?
The integration now includes enhanced error reporting that will show you exactly which environment variables are missing and what's available. Common fixes:
1. **Set variables at the service level**: In Railway, click on your service (not just the project) and add variables there
2. **Use the Raw Editor**: Go to Variables ‚Üí Raw Editor and paste all variables at once
3. **Redeploy after changes**: Railway sometimes needs a fresh deployment to pick up new variables
4. **Check the logs**: The improved error messages will list all available environment variables (with sensitive values hidden)

### Bot not posting messages?
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Ensure bot is invited to the channel: `/invite @Your Bot Name`
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check that your Slack bot token starts with `xoxb-`

### Getting rate limited?
- The integration respects Motion's rate limits (12 req/min for individuals, 120 for teams)
- If you see rate limit errors, the app will automatically retry

### State file issues?
- Delete `state.json` to reset and check all tasks from the last hour
- The app will recreate the state file automatically

### Can't find workspace ID?
- Try the `find_workspace_id.py` script first
- Check browser DevTools Network tab for `workspaceId` in Motion API calls
- Look for URLs like: `api.usemotion.com/v1/tasks?workspaceId=...`

## Architecture

- **main.py**: Core polling loop and orchestration
- **motion_client.py**: Motion API wrapper with retry logic
- **slack_client.py**: Slack API wrapper
- **state.json**: Tracks last check timestamp (created automatically)
